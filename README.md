# RobotPi
The software used for my robot built with a RaspberryPi.

Also known as the cat hunter, the RobotPi is a robot I built from scratch. I bought a chassis, a Raspberry Pi and a voltage regulator. 
It runs a server with NodeJS and streams the video through WebSockets. Socket.io is used for sending commands.
